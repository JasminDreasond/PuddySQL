# 🗂️ Welcome to `old/old/` – The Backup's Backup 📦📦

Yes... you read that right. This is the `old` folder **inside another `old` folder** 😅  
We’re officially in **archive inception** 🌀

This folder contains files so outdated 🧓, so forgotten 🕸️, they’ve been double-wrapped for safety.  
They're **not used**, **not maintained**, and **absolutely not pretty** 💀

🍮 **Tiny pudding-quality code alert!**  
This is peak legacy chaos, preserved only for historical curiosity or emotional damage control.

> "Why is it still here?"  
> We don’t know either. But deleting it feels... dangerous. 😬

So yeah — look, but don’t touch. And definitely don’t judge us 😶❤️
